\title{Get color palettes}
\usage{
mf_get_pal(n, palette, alpha = NULL, rev = c(FALSE, FALSE), neutral)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of colors (>= 1) to be in the palette.}

\item{palette}{a valid palette name (one of hcl.pals()). The name is matched
to
the list of available palettes, ignoring upper vs. lower case, spaces,
dashes,
etc. in the matching.}

\item{alpha}{an alpha-transparency level in the range [0,1] (0 means
transparent and 1 means opaque), see argument alpha in hsv and hcl,
respectively.}

\item{rev}{logical indicating whether the ordering of the colors should be
reversed.}

\item{neutral}{a color, if two gradients are used, the 'neutral' color can be
added between them.}
}
\value{
A vector of colors.
}
\description{
\code{mf_get_pal} builds sequential, diverging and
qualitative color palettes.
Diverging color palettes can be dissymmetric (different number of colors in
each of the two gradients).
}
\details{
See \link{hcl.pals} to get available palette names.
If two gradients are used, the 'neutral' color can be added between them.
