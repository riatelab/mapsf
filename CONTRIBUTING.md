# Contributing to mapsf

This outlines how to propose a change to `mapsf`.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.
This generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file.
You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed.
If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).

### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer.

*   Install all development dependencies, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check.
    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing.
*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR).

*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header).

### Code style

*  We use [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) with current default values for code style.

*  We use [lintr]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lintr) with current default values for static code analysis.

*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) for documentation.

*  We use [tinytest](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tinytest) for unit tests.
   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
