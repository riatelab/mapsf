  description: >
    Create and integrate thematic maps in your workflow. This package
    helps to design various cartographic representations such as proportional
    symbols, choropleth or typology maps. It also offers several functions to
    display layout elements that improve the graphic presentation of maps
    (e.g. scale bar, north arrow, title, labels). 'mapsf' maps 'sf' objects on
    'base' graphics.
